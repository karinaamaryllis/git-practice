                <h4>Frustration is the norm!</h4>
                <p>Don't be that person that gives up because it's hard! Maybe until this point, you've done what made
                    more sense to you. But I have news for you. Bad grades and complete failure are normal in STEM majors. 
                    You think all those pre-med students had perfect A's? Neither did the CS majors. And if you didn't go 
                    to a formal college, then you likely either broke your body or your mind trying to learn your job. It's normal.
                </p>

                <p>Learning this stuff is not linear. One minute you will feel elated that you finally understood something.
                    The next you will have landed in the equivalent of learning molasses where your brain struggles to grasp something.
                    Just remember that you're trying to make progress, and however incremental, it's towards your long term goals versus
                    short term survival.
                </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
